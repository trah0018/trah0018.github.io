        <p>
            I was born on October 10<sup>th</sup> 2003 in the province of Quebec. I lived in a small town populated by 20000 citizens for pretty much my whole life. I have an older brother named Edward and a younger sister named Mina-Fee. I also currently have two Germain sheperd dogs, Gandalf and Sanna, and a cat named Maui.

            Two months ago, My family and I moved to a new town called Huntsville in ontario. Shortly after I was at Huntsville, I moved again to Ottawa to attend my new school, Algonquin College. I am currently taking <em>Interactive Media Design</em> or <abbr title="Interactive Media desing">IMD</abbr> the goal to pass all my courses, and obtain a job where i can use my creativity as a tool.
